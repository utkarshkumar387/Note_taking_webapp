Hello,

This project is done on react library of javascript. In this project you can able to add and delete notes which is done by using localstorage.

To run this project on your desktop ar laptop you have to follow these steps:

1) You have to install react in your desktop by writing npm install -save react in your terminal. (I am assuming node.js   is installed in your desktop)

2) Then you have to write npm start in your terminal which will start the server.
